	<h1 class="pagetitle">Costs of Green Energy</h1>
		<p>Wind, hydropower, solar biomass, and geothermal energy contributed to 20% of US electricity in 2021. As fossil fuels become more expensive, the cost of green energy sources is falling. The interest, investment, and development of green energy solutions continues to help bring costs down. The cost of green energy varies on factors which should be taken in consideration when developing green energy initiative projects:</p>
	<h4>Technology</h4>
		<p>Different renewable energy technologies have different costs. Solar photovolatic panels and wind turbines are examples of green energy initiatives that have declined in costs significantly due to technological advancements, economies, and increased manufacturing efficiency</p>
	<h4>Location</h4>
		<p>The location can affect the availability and quality of renewable energy resources which can increase costs if there is a lack of renewable resources and decrease costs if there is an abundance. The site of installing the technology can also affect project costs.</p>
	<h4>Scale</h4>
		<p>Large scale renewable energy projects benefit from economies of scale as the renewable energy industry grows</p>
	<h4>Maintenance</h4>
		<p>Green energy initiatives tend to be lower operational and maintenance costs as they have fewer moving parts and rely on freely available resources. It can cost trillions of dollars to transition to an electric system that is 100% renewable. These costs can range from $4.5 trillion by 2030 to $5.7 trillion in 2040. Allowing existing nuclear plants to operate can save about $500 billion in costs.</p>
